# Clustering_PCA_Analysis

Introduction

The Madelon dataset is a high-dimensional dataset with 500 features and 2,600 data points, generated for a machine learning competition. It has a highly non-linear structure, making it an interesting dataset to explore with dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and clustering algorithms like k-means.

In this project, we will first apply k-means clustering on the dataset and investigate how the number of clusters affects the clustering performance. We will also preprocess the dataset using PCA and visualize the data in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, we will apply k-means clustering on the transformed data and compare the clustering results with the original data.
